During the talk I'll be taking you on a journey where we'll be learning to script in an unconventional setting by writing a small game from scratch for the terminal. We'll be dealing with some fundamental scripting techniques, my terrible game design skills and hopefully at the end... a working game. This talk aims to help you acquire valuable scripting knowledge and techniques, while also highlighting why PowerShell and other scripting languages are an accessible and versatile tool for solving a wide range of problems.
