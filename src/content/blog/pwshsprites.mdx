While procrastinating about setting up this blog I wanted to create a favicon in a pixel art style. Instead of creating the icon I got carried away spaghetti coding a pixel art editor for the terminal in PowerShell...  

<video class="w-full" controls autoplay poster="/pwshsprites/preview.png" >
    <source src="/pwshsprites/corn.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

To open the editor run <code>./PwshEditor.ps1</code>
For <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/reply?id=33010477&goto=item%3Fid%3D33008834%2333010477">those who like vim</a> <code>./SpriteEditor.ps1 -AppSettingsPath "appsettings.vim.json"</code>
The editor controls are all indicated in the UI apart from pressing [SPACE] to draw pixels and arrow keys to move. Snake mode will make the pen or eraser constantly apply changes as you navigate the canvas.

<div id="editor-container" class="flex justify-around">
    <img class="w-1/2" src="/pwshsprites/editor1.png" alt="an image of some aws badges in the powershell sprite editor" />
    <img class="w-1/2" src="/pwshsprites/editor2.png" alt="an image of the pokemon red protagonist in the powershell sprite editor" />
</div>

To open the viewer run <code>./PwshViewer.ps1</code>
This will start a PowerShell web server and open a page showing all of the images in the sprites folder. There is a problem with ctrl-c being caught in the terminal so sometimes you need to close the window to stop the web server. I think using a background job would stop this occurring but I haven't tried it yet.

<div class="centered">
    <img src="/pwshsprites/viewer.png" alt="an image of the powershell sprite viewer" />
</div>
