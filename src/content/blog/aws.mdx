I decided to sign up for the AWS Solutions Architect Professional, DevOps Professional and Security Specialist exams which gave me ~ 2 weeks to study so I had to cram quite a bit to pass. I've posted my results and study materials here in case it helps anyone.
Prior to this I had spent a long time with my head in the clouds but I'd say I've only really gotten more involved in infrastructure configuration and provisioning in the last 4 years.

### Practical Preparation

Just studying definitions and documentation it doesn't really stick for me so while reading the AWS docs I would fire up any products I was not familiar with on my personal AWS account.

- <a href="https://github.com/ShaunLawrie/PwshRayTracerLambda">I updated my crappy PowerShell Ray Tracer I had been working on to run on Lambda</a> deploying the infrastructure via Terraform. This was a mistake because for the purposes of studying I should have used Cloudformation but I really dislike it ðŸ˜…
- I moved one of my old projects to the AWS Code* family of tools to get familiar with all the CodeCommit/Build/Deploy/Pipeline tooling in AWS

### PDFs
Here are my study notes from the exams. They have sanitised results and some thoughts I recorded after walking out of the exam room. Some people got results immediately but I had to wait ~9 hours to receive the email from Credly saying my results had been processed.
